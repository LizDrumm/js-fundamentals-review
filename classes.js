We have a school to build here! In this project you will get used to thinking about classes in JavaScript and building them from a brand new data set.

/* 
Pokemon
 - First we need a Pokemon class. This will be our base-class
 - Pokemon receives name, height, weight, level as props
 - Every Pokemon should also be initialized with a health attribute set to 50
 - Pokemon receives sleep as a method.
    - This method will return the pokemon's health to 100
- Pokemon receives levelUp as a method.
    - This method should increase the pokemon's level by 1*/

    class Pokemon {
        constructor (attributes){
        this.name = attributes.name;
        this.height= attributes.height;
        this.weight= attributes.weight;
        this.levels = attributes.level;
        this.health = 50;
    }

levelUp(){
    this.level += 1 //++ or += but cant do just plus
    }

sleep (){
 health =100
    }
  
}





/*FireType
 - Now that we have a Pokemon as our base class, we'll build our FireType class.
 - FireType uses the same attributes that have been set up by Pokemon
 - FireType has the following unique props:
     - type property set to 'fire'
     - nickname property
     - weaknesses property initialized to an array with the values 'water', 'ground', 'rock'
 - FireType has the following methods:
     - fireAttack which should return the string `${name} just blew a giant fireball.'
*/
